Dark eye resting coloscheme designed for use in urxvt or urxvt/screen terminals.
It makes heavy use of the 88 colors available in this environment and it will not work in any other environment e.g. xterm or gui.

You can set a transparent background by adding

'let g:bluez_transbg=1' 

to your vimrc.
